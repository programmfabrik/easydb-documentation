Connecting CMS-Systems in easydb works via [Plugins](../../../datamanagement/features/plugins). The settings for the connection of CMS systems are made here.


## Wordpress {#wordpress}

If the [installation of the plugin](/en/sysadmin/configuration/easydb-server.yml/plugins/) is finished successfully, you will find the configuration block for Wordpress in the <code class="tab">CMS</code> tab.

1. Enter an instance name and your URL and choose an authentication method (see details in the table below the screenshot).
2. Save the basic configuration after successful authentication.

> NOTE: Required are Wordpress 4.7 or higher, an active JSON-Rest-API (is default) and a configured authentication.
