# Version 5.132.0

*Released on 2024-05-08*


# Webfrontend

## New

* **Show History on Editor**:
  * Added the ability to view the history change of an object while in the sidebar editor
  * Previously, this was only possible if we were in the detail of the object

## Improved

* **Request Data**:
  * Optimized the sending of JSON in requests made by the frontend
  * This results in a reduction of request size in certain scenarios such as in large data models
* **JSON Importer**: Improved display of error messages generated by the JSON importer
* **Zoomer**:
  * Enhancements have been made to the zoomer tool to zoom in on the asset browser
  * These improvements include better visualization of images with transparency and optimizations when using very large images as a source
* **Password Field**: Improvements have been made to the password fields concerning the show/hide password button
* **Base Config Upload**: Improved compatibility of base config exports between *easydb5* and *fylr*

## Fixed

* **Full Screen Detail**: Several fixes have been made to the full screen detail, especially when working with objects that do not contain assets
* **Detail View**:
  * Fixes the detail sidebar attempting to load objects that are not ready when we just created one but it was not yet indexed
  * Now the detail can wait for indexing
* **Table View**: Fixed a bug where rows that should not have opened in the Table View were opening after performing a search
* **Collection Manager**: Fixed an issue where, under certain circumstances, the collection manager would automatically update, disrupting the user's workflow
* **CSV Importer**: Fixed a bug when importing texts with line breaks, which were erroneously detected as multiple values in a nested field
* **Base Type Sorting**:
  * Fixed the language selection for sorting base types
  * Now the language set for the frontend will be used
* **Login**: Fixed a bug where an error message was displayed if there was a cookie with a very old session
* **Data Sorting**: Corrected the language used to order data in the application
* **Logo Customization**: Fixed a bug where the field to configure the logo in the base config was not displayed correctly
* **Date Columns**:
  * Date columns in records will correctly use the language set as the database language
  * previously, the frontend language was used to format the dates in these fields


# Server

## New

* **Server processes**: Max request size can now be defined in server config value `max_request_size_mb`

## Improved

* Changed date format for `en-US`: use `YYYY-MM-DD` instead of `MM/DD/YYYY`

## Fixed

* **Metadata Import**: import profiles: remove broken video attributes
* **Schema Upgrade**:
  * updated renamed collection pool link fields
  * remove linked object pool field from collection settings if it has been removed
